# AEVS-AADHAAR-ENABLED-VOTING-SYSTEM

The solution of lost votes is 
AEVS - AADHAAR ENABLED VOTING SYSTEM.

THIS SYSTEM IS QUIET SIMILAR TO THE EXISTING AEPS SYSTEM UNDER WHICH ANY INDIAN CAN 
WITHDRAW MONEY FROM ANY WHERE IN THE COUNTRY. In the same manner we can cast vote. 
Especially those who are out of their constituencies.

PROCESS OF AEVS
VOTER just have to go to a shop. The shopkeeper will take their AADHAAR number and put it into the 
app and then he will scan the fingerprint of the voter and put his/ her mobile number. Then a message 
come to his /her mobile number which will include the codes of different political parties in his 
constituency ( the code will be different for each voter just like OTP). Thus maintaining Anonymity. The 
voter will tell the code of his favourite party to the shopkeeper and shopkeeper will enter the code in 
the app and thus voting is done.

Benefits of the AEVS.
1. ALMOST EVERY INDIAN HAS AN AADHAAR CARD.( wide coverage)
2. THEIR IS ATLEAST ONE SHOP IN A LOCALITY WHICH HAS AEPS.(ease of casting vote)
3. SHOPKEEPERS HAS TO BUY NOTHING BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE FINGERPRINT
 SENSOR (cause they are already doing AEPS Payment)
4. SHOPKEEPERS HAVE TO JUST INSTALL AN APP( in which vote will be caste)
5.AADHAAR CARD ALREADY INCLUDE OUR ADDRESS ( so their will no problem of voting in wrong 
constituency) 
6. THE CODE OF POLITICAL PARTY CHANGES EVERYTIME THUS MAINTAINING ANONYMITY ( neither the 
shopkeeper nor anyone else can know to whom vote has been cast.

CONCLUSION
AEVS is based on existing AEPS system. Due to which government doesn't have to invest more on 
infrastructure. Their is no doubt in security because AEPS system is quiet secure. This system is easy to 
operate and if government want to implement it government can implement it under a year. Due to all 
these benefits we must opt AEVS for lost votes.
